# Create a Proposal Template

##### About this document
This document steps you through the process of making a proposal template (like those in the [proposal repsository](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates).  Anyone can then use them for their proposals. 

### Steps for making a proposal template
1. Make a skeleton of each section to be included
2. Under each section, put two subsection headings
  1. Description
  2. Example
3. Make Description and Example headings smallest size possible (6 hashes: ######)
4. Populate each section with a description and an example
  * The guide for *using* templates assumes these sections are present
  * The guide instructs users to remove the headings and revise the content
